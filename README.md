# Superstore Performance and Discount Impact Analysis

### Background/Objective

Superstore has experienced steady sales volumes over time, but overall profitability has remained low, with certain periods showing outright losses. To uncover the root cause, an analysis was carried out examining sales and profit trends, profit distribution across customer segments, product categories, and subcategories, as well as the impact of discounting strategies on business performance. The ultimate objective was to identify actionable insights to reduce losses and drive sustainable profitability.

### Tools/Skills

- Excel
- Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Data Analysis (EDA, Data Segmentation)
- Data Visualization & Storytelling

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

These headline metrics summarize Superstore’s performance during the period analyzed:

- Total Sales: $2,297,201
- Total Profit: $286,397
- Profit vs. Loss Breakdown:
    - ✅ 81.28% of sales were profitable
    - ❌ 18.72% of sales resulted in a loss

### Insights

#### Sales and Profit Trends

- Sales volumes remained consistently strong across time.
- While profits followed a similar upward trend, the magnitude of profit was disproportionately low compared to sales. This indicates that growth in sales was not translating into strong profitability.
- The percentage of sales resulting in a loss is a critical red flag, revealing that nearly one-fifth of the business operated at a loss and highlighting significant profitability challenges.

#### Profit by Segment

- The Consumer segment emerged as the most profitable, followed by the Corporate segment, with the Home Office segment contributing the least to overall profitability.

#### Profit by Category & Subcategory

- Technology was the most profitable category, recording no losses. Within it, subcategories such as Copiers, Phones, and Accessories delivered the highest profit contributions.
- Office Supplies ranked next in profitability, generally performing well overall, though one subcategory did incur losses.
- Furniture was the weakest-performing category, consistently showing lower margins, with Tables and Bookcases contributing most significantly to losses.

#### Discounting Impact

- Discount vs. Profit: A clear negative relationship was observed.
- At lower discount ranges (0–10%), profit margins were healthy.
- At higher discount ranges (above 20%), profits declined sharply, turning into losses.
- Overall, approximately 18% of total sales transactions resulted in a loss, strongly linked to aggressive discounting.
- Discount vs. Sales Volume: Contrary to expectation, higher discounts did not significantly increase sales volumes. Sales remained relatively stable regardless of discount level, indicating that excessive discounts were not driving additional demand.

### Conclusion

Superstore’s weak profitability is largely attributable to an unsustainable discounting strategy. Deep discounts significantly eroded profit margins without generating a corresponding increase in sales, resulting in recurring losses despite steady sales growth.

### Recommendations

#### Revise Discount Strategy
- Reduce maximum allowable discount from 80% to 30%.
- Lower average discount rates from 16% to 5–10%, aligning with industry best practices.
- Restrict discounts above 20% to strategic promotions only and closely track their impact on profitability.
  
#### Optimize Category Performance
- Prioritize sales growth in high-margin categories such as Technology.
- Reassess pricing and discount structures in underperforming categories, particularly Furniture.

#### Strengthen Loss Prevention Measures
- Enforce stricter approval controls for discounting to minimize unprofitable transactions.
- Conduct regular profitability reviews at the subcategory level to quickly identify and address recurring losses.
